# Self-Evaluation

1. Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- I am most proud being able to sucessfully write a function! I was conufsed about storing the return value in a function as a variable, at first I was tryind to declare the variable outside of the function but I realized it was asking me to delcare it inside.

2. In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
- Functions are a powerful tool because they allow us to re use a piece of code as many times as we want inside an application.
